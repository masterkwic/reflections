Why would you want to create a remote rather than to have all the files stored on your local machine?

Because if my local disc fails, I always have the copy of the files on the remote. I can also upload any file from any place and it will land in my remote repository.

I would want changes to be pulled manually bcoz i don't know who and when may add some changes to the remote repo. I don't want to pull all the changes whenever they appear in the remote.


Forking clones a branch on github onto your github account. cloning clones it onto your local machine and branches can be present both on your local machine andyour github.

Many benefits ;);)


Without git and github I quess i would have to manually create versions of my files on for example dropbox and then if I wanted someone to review it I would just ask them to take a look at my file. It would be less complicated then remembering all commands from git but it would also be very limited.

Separate branch is for experimenting. Master can also be used for experimenting but it's nicer to have one "official - good" branch.

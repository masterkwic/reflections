when i create a respository i can then use git commands like commit and when i have the Internet connection I can synch my repository with the online one

staging area vs working directory, staging area is sort of temp directory where files are not yet commited.




I can make sure that i have only 1 file in the staging area.


It would be helpful if I wanted to experiment, branching would keep it clean and safe, in case the experiment goes wrong ;)

The diagrams helped me to visualise the branch structure a lot. 

Automatic merge merges changes made on the same file made (probably) by 2 different programmers working on a different part of the code.

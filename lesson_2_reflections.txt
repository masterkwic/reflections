when i create a respository i can then use git commands like commit and when i have the Internet connection I can synch my repository with the online one

staging area vs working directory, staging area is sort of temp directory where files are not yet commited.




I can make sure that i have only 1 file in the staging area.


It would be helpful if I wanted to experiment, branching would keep it clean and safe, in case the experiment goes wrong ;)

The diagrams helped me to visualise the branch structure a lot. 

Automatic merge merges changes made on the same file made (probably) by 2 different programmers working on a different part of the code.

Automatic merges pros : it's fast and accurate in the way that it seems what code is different, cons is that sometimes there may be conflicts and we will have to do it manually as well. Manual merges pros : you merge exactly what you want, but cons are that you may miss changes from anothe person or just make a typo.
